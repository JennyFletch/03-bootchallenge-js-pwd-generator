Bootcamp Challenge Assignment 3: Use Javascript to create a password-generator

## Bootcamp Challenge Assignment - Module 03
The challenge for Module 3 was to build password-creation functionality into a page of existing HTML and CSS. The structure needed to be extended to give the user the ability to generate a random password with a customizable selection of characters. Special checks needed to be added as well, to limit the password's size and to ensure at least one character type was selected by the user.
